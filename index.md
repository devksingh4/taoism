# Overview
## TL;DR
The Han dynasty became very corrupt at the end of the second century A.D. due to the excessive powers held by certain families.[^1] To fight this corruption, two primarily Taoist movements (The Yellow Turban movement and the Celestial Masters movement) emerged to fight the Han's corruption. These taoist movements evolved Taoism by developing organization structures and rituals which demonstrated Taoism's evolution from a disorganized philosophy to an organized religion.

## Taoism Before Revolution
In its early form, Taoism was highly philosophical, and not conducive to organization. Laozi’s Taoism was both disorganized and highly philosophical. The Tao Te Ching emphasizes not attaching oneself to frivolous pursuits. It instructs adherents of Taoism to weaken their ambition and toughen their resolve so that they may practice “not doing” and detaching from desire.[^2]
