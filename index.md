# Summary
The Han dynasty became very corrupt at the end of the second century A.D. due to the excessive powers held by certain families.[^1] To fight this corruption, two primarily Taoist movements (The Yellow Turban movement and the Celestial Masters movement) emerged to fight the Han's corruption. These Taoist movements evolved Taoism by developing organization structures and rituals which demonstrated Taoism's evolution from a disorganized philosophy to an organized religion.
# Taoism Before Revolution
In its early form, Taoism was highly philosophical, and not conducive to organization. Laozi’s Taoism was both disorganized and highly philosophical. The Tao Te Ching emphasizes not attaching oneself to frivolous pursuits. It instructs adherents of Taoism to weaken their ambition and toughen their resolve so that they may practice “not doing” and detaching from desire.[^2] At the time, Laozi was critical of attempts to unify and control China. For example, in a meeting between Laozi and Confucious, Laozi berated Confucious for wanting to zealously lead China.[^3] In Chapter 57 of the Tao Te Ching, Laozi also wrote that leaders should stay out of the way of their people, and a Taoism organized under Laozi would have required Laozi to interefere in the way that his practicioners act.[^4]

# The Second Century A.D.: Revolution
The second century A.D. brought about changes to Taoism with the emergence of religious Taoism. Two movements in the period were responsible for this organization: The Yellow Turban movement in eastern China and the Five Bushels of Rice movement (or the Celestial Masters' movement) in southwest China.[^5]

# The Yellow Turban Movement
The Yellow Turban movement had its origins in the adoption of Confucianism as the official philosophy in the Han dynasty causing “cleavage between the official doctrine and the more marginal Taoist movements”.[^6] Led by Zhuang Jue, the movement protested the Han Dynasty’s misrule and corruption in the mid to late Han Dynasty. They desired to lead China with Taoist ideals, which led to a permanent evolution of Taoism’s formation of a religion.	
## Impacts on Religion
Even though the Yellow Turban movement was swiftly put down by the Han dynasty in 215 A.D., its development process was integral to Taoism’s transformation into a religion. [^7]
The Taoists introduced prayer into their religion to ward off and cure diseases directly before and during the Yellow Turban movement. In the years leading up to the rebellion, Chang Ling developed the movement of The Way of the Heavenly Masters as a precursor to the Yellow Turban rebellion, which developed the concept of prayer as a cure for diseases. Sickness was regarded as “an external indication of hidden wrongdoing” and was cured by Taoist priests who conducted various ceremonies for removing this disease.[^8] 
### Comparison with Established Religion
This concept of sickness being a problem with the spirit is also present in many other accepted religions, including in Christianity, and demonstrates how Taoism is a religion. According to the New Testament, Christians should pray to heal ailments so that the Lord may heal them, a similar concept as to what Taoism developed. The New Testament states that “the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up.”[^9]
### Eastern Yellow Turban Movement - A Twist
The eastern sect of the Yellow Turbans developed slightly different methods of absolution for curing sickness in a form of religion. In this sect, a patient had to kneel and touch their forehead to the ground, bow their heads, and reflect on their sins. The other members then “recited magic formulae over water and gave it to the patient to drink,” where if the patient was cured, they understand the way of the Tao.[^10]
Taoists also developed rituals in “the art of the furnace to summon spirits”.[^11] Using fire to summon spirits and water to cleanse souls are also practices in established religions which further supports that Taoism transitioned into a religion. As water cleanses in Taoism, holy water in Hinduism also cleanses the soul both in this life and the next with its divine qualities.
## Impacts on Organization
Along with its contributions to the Taoist formation of religion, the Yellow Turban movement played a crucial part in developing Taoism’s organized form. Their organized forms, which originated to fight the Han dynasty, also remained for some time after the revolution’s suppression. The organization of Taoism religious, military, and political structures remained similar throughout the country. Chang Chueh was the leader of the Yellow Turbans in the east and commanded eight provinces split into thirty-six districts, which demonstrates how Taoism developed organization.[^12] Their structure resulted in a solid and largely respected leadership hierarchy with strict chains of command, and formed due to the Yellow Turban revolution and provided Taoism a major organized form. 

# The Celestial Masters Movement
In the southwest part of China, the Five Bushels of Rice movement further demonstrated Taoism’s advancement into a religion. Later called the Celestial Masters movement, it gained its original name from the process of obtaining a cure or absolution of their sins. 
## Impacts on Religion
Patients “gave the adepts five pecks of rice to cover the cost of confinement,” after which the patient’s name, surname, and confirmation of desire to absolve themselves were written along with the rice.  The patient made three copies and placed them in different locations: one on a mountain, one deep in the earth, and the last in the water to represent the Taoist elements.  The patient was now said to be absolved and cured of any ailment. [^13] The founders of the movement were also worshipped as ancestors, along with the definition of clear religious deference structures. [^14]
### Comparison with Established Religion
Religions commonly have specific rituals that one must perform to treat themselves, and this sect of Taoism is no different with the rice ritual. Like Christianity’s and the Yellow Turban revolution’s processes to be cured of ailments, the Celestial Masters’ movement developed a religious curing process. A religious hierarchy was adopted, which took cues from the Han dynasty: titles such as “liberationer”, “director”, and “recorder” were bestowed based upon a practitioner’s rank and duty, similar to how Hinduism established the religious caste system defining the position of adherents within the religion and society. [^15] [^16] The Celestial Masters also derived the purpose for their spells and prayers from written texts which commands them to pray, similar to how the Bible commands its followers to pray. [^17] [^18]
## Impacts on the organized form
The Celestial Masters established a line of rule under their own, dividing the newly formed state of Sichuan into twenty-four regions of administrative and religious power. Each resident was placed in their district based on their birth sign, and each district had 240 armies made up of generals, officers, and soldiers who all reported to the Celestial Masters. [^19] It is clear from the various bureaucratic structures that the Celestial Masters’ movement leadership structure became highly organized. There was a clear division of responsibility and area, a defined hierarchy directly linked to the leaders of the Celestial Masters movement, and a highly stratified military with delineated chains of command. The direct link between the religious and administrative structure meant that a more rigid structure formed to lead the Taoist adherents through spirit and demonstrates Taoism’s organization.
