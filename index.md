# Overview
## TL;DR
The Han dynasty became very corrupt at the end of the second century A.D. due to the excessive powers held by certain families.[^1] To fight this corruption, two primarily Taoist movements (The Yellow Turban movement and the Celestial Masters movement) emerged to fight the Han's corruption. These taoist movements evolved Taoism by developing organization structures and rituals which demonstrated Taoism's evolution from a disorganized philosophy to an organized religion.

## Taoism Before Revolution
In its early form, Taoism was highly philosophical, and not conducive to organization. Laozi’s Taoism was both disorganized and highly philosophical. The Tao Te Ching emphasizes not attaching oneself to frivolous pursuits. It instructs adherents of Taoism to weaken their ambition and toughen their resolve so that they may practice “not doing” and detaching from desire.[^2] At the time, Laozi was critical of attempts to unify and control China. For example, in a meeting between Laozi and Confucious, Laozi berated Confucious for wanting to zealously lead China.[^3] In Chapter 57 of the Tao Te Ching, Laozi also wrote that leaders should stay out of the way of their people, and a Taoism organized under Taozi would have required Laozi to interefere in the way that his practicioners act.[^4]

## The Second Century A.D.: Revolution
As stated before, the second century A.D. brought about changes to Taoism with the emergence of religious Taoism. Two movements in the period were responsible for this organization: The Yellow Turban movement in eastern China and the Five Bushels of Rice movement (or the Celestial Masters' movement) in southwest China.[^5]

### The Yellow Turban Movement and Taoist Religion
The Yellow Turban movement had its origins in the adoption of Confucianism as the official philosophy in the Han dynasty causing “cleavage between the official doctrine and the more marginal Taoist movements”.[^6] Led by Zhuang Jue, the movement protested the Han Dynasty’s misrule and corruption in the mid to late Han Dynasty. They desired to lead China with Taoist ideals, which led to a permanent evolution of Taoism’s formation of a religion.	Even though the Yellow Turban movement was swiftly put down by the Han dynasty in 215 A.D., its development process was integral to Taoism’s transformation into a religion. [^7]
